        <h2 class="o-1 text-primary">Why BMA?</h2>
        <p class="o-2">
          There is a major shift towards scale-out deployments in datacenters.
          Scale-out is driven by a new era of software (On-Prem Cloud, HPC,
          AI/ML, Containers, VMWare Virtualization, VDI, etc.). However,
          organizations are facing significant friction with the onboarding,
          provisioning and management of their physical hardware. Hardware is an
          expensive and difficult resource to deploy within a data center,
          driving organizations to move to the cloud.
        </p>

        <p class="o-4">
          RedefinIT BMA addresses the key challenges in managing bare-metal
          servers by providing a simplified approach to OS installation and
          Firmware updates. It uses modern industry standard technologies and
          protocols to automate OS installation and Firmware updates in a
          secure, faster and reliable way. This product supports multiple vendor
          hardware and multiple operating systems and hypervisors, making it a
          versatile tool in the modern enterprise datacenter. It is highly
          scalable to handle large-scale deployments. With RESTful API
          interface, this tool can be easily integrated with O&M (orchestration
          and management) tools such as Ansible, Terraform etc. for complete
          end-to-end automation of Day-1 and Day-2 operations for bare-metal
          server infrastructure.

    <!-- How it Works -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-primary">How it Works</h2>
        <p>
          BMA allows automated deployment of OS and firmware updates using ISO
          (ISO-9660) format images that are either vendor provided or custom
          created. At the end of the deployment, the server will be ready with
          an operating system which is accessible over network using the IP
          address assigned by BMA.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-primary">Pre-requisites</h3>
        <p>
          The BMA software is distributed as an installable package which can be
          installed on a Linux machine. The tool requires network connectivity
          to the server BMC as well as to the host OS primary network. BMA uses
          the installed host OS primary network to ping-test for detecting the
          OS installation completion.
        </p>
        <p><b>BMA requirements:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>RHEL/Centos 7.8, 8.0 or later</li>
          <li>Python 3.6.8</li>
          <li>NGINX 1.14.1 or later</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3 class="text-primary">Overview</h3>
        <img src="/images/bma-slide2.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 1000px" />
        <p>
          BMA has a built-in images repository which is a HTTPS File Server
          powered by NGINX. It interfaces with bare-metal servers for device
          discovery and deployment.
        </p>
        <p><b>BMA operates in two modes:</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>Server BMC</b> - BMA uses Redfish to interact with the server BMC
          for hardware discovery and OS/ Firmware deployment. The supported BMCs
          are HPE iLO5 and Dell iDRAC9.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hardware Managers</b> - BMA interfaces with Hardware managers to
          perform discovery and deployment for the servers that are managed. The
          hardware provisioning capabilities of the hardware managers can be
          combined with BMA's OS deployment capabilities to achieve end-to-end
          server lifecycle management.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3 class="text-primary">
          Preparation for basic OS deployment using direct BMC
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Upload the OS installation media ISO image.</li>
            <li>Upload Firmware bundle ISO image</li>
            <li>
              Generate deployment specification JSON file or use web-GUI.
              Specify the following:
              <ul>
                <li>BMC IP, username, password</li>
                <li>OS image</li>
                <li>Firmware bundle image</li>
                <li>For each host, the static IP, netmask, gateway and DNS.</li>
                <li>
                  Network port identified using adapter-id and port-id. (Refer
                  to next section for network ports identification)

        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3 class="text-primary">Deployment Process</h3>
        <p>
          The following diagram illustrates the typical deployment process using
          BMA:
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bma-slide1.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 1000px" />
        <br />
        <h3 class="text-primary">Identifying network ports for the server</h3>
        <p>
          BMA configures the host IP address using the network port (or NIC)
          that is specified in the input JSON. The desired network port can be
          specified using the parameters adapterId and portId.
        </p>
        <p>
          The network adapters and ports are identified using 1-based index
          number used by the server BMC when it enumerates them in the GUI or
          command-line output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following diagram shows HPE iLO5 screenshot with the network
          adapters information and also shows how the JSON data to be coded for
          choosing a network port that should get the host IP Address:
        </p>

        <img src="/images/NIC_selection.png" alt="" style="width: 1000px" />

        <p>
          This approach eliminates need for using MAC address to specify the
          network port to the OS deployer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="text-primary">Identifying storage drives for the server</h3>
        <p>
          BMA configures the host IP address using the network port (or NIC)
          that is specified in the input JSON. The desired network port can be
          specified using the parameters adapterId and portId.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Use Cases</h2>
        <h3 class="text-primary">VCF Automation</h3>
        <p>
          VCF deployment needs the physical hosts installed with the right
          version of ESXi hypervisor; which is installed with an IP address from
          the management network assigned to one of its network ports. The VCF
          software can automate the rest of the steps in creating a VCF
          environment with VCenter, VSAN and NSX, making it ready for
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          VSAN needs local drives in a clean state without any filesystem
          partitions as it can be tedious to cleanup the drives before deploying
          the servers to VCF. If the initial physical hosts deployment can be
          automated, then end-to-end automation can be achieved for VCF Day-1
          and Day-2 operations.

      <p>
        With the increasing adoption of container platforms for running
        enterprise applications, there is an opportunity to eliminate the
        licensing costs and performance costs from virtualization. The
        containers can give the isolation and multi-tenancy to run multiple
        workloads on a single host which has so far been possible only with
        virtualization. However, most container platform deployments are based
        on virtualization infrastructure as against physical infrastructure.This
        is in part due to hesitancy to run containers on bare-metal servers
        without adding a virtualization layer in between the physical
        infrastructure and the container platform. The primary reason is the
        complexity involved with managing the bare-metal servers, which gets
        worse with managing multi-vendor hardware. The challenges with
        bare-metal servers does not exist in the virtualization as a VM is the
        same irrespective of the underlying physical infrastructure. The tooling
        for virtualized environment can be totally independent of the vendor of
        the underlying physical hardware. However, this is not the case with
        multi-vendor bare-metal infrastructure.There will be significant cost
        saving and increased utilization of compute resources when the container
        platforms run on bare-metal servers. This needs tooling that allow the
        deployment and provisioning to be fully automated with multi-vendor
        hardware support. The minimum the automation code to handle different
        hardware (with different model/generation/vendor), the better the
        automation experience.
