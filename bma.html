        <h2 class="o-1 text-primary">Why BMA?</h2>
        <p class="o-2">There is a major shift towards scale-out deployments in datacenters.
          Scale-out is driven by a new era of software (On-Prem Cloud, HPC, AI/ML, Containers, VMWare Virtualization, VDI, etc.). However, organizations are facing significant friction with the onboarding, provisioning and management of their physical hardware. Hardware is an expensive and difficult resource to deploy within a data center driving organizations to move to the cloud.</p>
          
          <p class="o-4"> RedefinIT BMA addresses the key challenges in managing bare-metal servers by providing a simplified approach to OS installation and Firmware updates. It uses modern industry standard technologies and protocols to automate OS installation and Firmware updates in a secure, faster and reliable way. This product supports multiple vendor hardware and multiple operating systems and hypervisors, making it a versatile tool in the modern enterprise datacenter. It is highly scalable to handle large-scale deployments. With RESTful API interface, this tool can be easily integrated with O&M (orchestration and management) tools such as Ansible, Terraform etc. for complete end-to-end automation of Day-1 and Day-2 operations for bare-metal server infrastructure.</p>

    <h2 class="text-primary">Use Cases</h2>
    <h3 class="subhead">VCF Automation
    </h3>
    <p>VCF deployment needs the physical hosts installed with the right version of ESXi hypervisor; which is installed with an IP address from the management network assigned to one of its network ports. The VCF software can automate the rest of the steps in creating VCF environment with VCenter, VSAN and NSX, ready for production.</p>
     <p> VSAN needs local drives in a clean state without any filesystem partitions as it can be tedious to cleanup the drives before deploying the servers to VCF.
      If the initial physical hosts deployment can be automated, then end-to-end automation can be achieved for VCF Day-1 and Day-2 operations. </p>
      <p>BMA can automate bare-metal physical hosts deployment with the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Updates the server Firmware using Firmware updates bundle in ISO format.</li>
        <li>Installs OS with the following customizations:
          <ol>
            <li>Assigns management IP address to one NIC.</li>
            <li>Cleanup of all local drives by removing any pre-existing filesystem partitions.</li>
            <li>Enables/disables services as mandated by VCF pre-requisites.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        
      </ol>

  <section class="section container">
    <h2 class="text-primary">Kubernetes Containers Platformation</h2>
    <p>With the increasing adoption of container platforms for running enterprise applications, there is an opportunity to eliminate the licensing costs and performance costs from virtualization. The containers can give the isolation and multi-tenancy to run multiple workloads on a single host which has so far been possible only with virtualization. However, most container platform deployments are based on virtualization infrastructure as against physical infrastructure.This is in part due to hesitancy to run containers on bare-metal servers without adding a virtualization layer in between the physical infrastructure and the container platform. The primary reason is the complexity involved with managing the bare-metal servers, which gets worse with managing multi-vendor hardware. The challenges with bare-metal servers does not exist in the virtualization as a VM is the same irrespective of the underlying physical infrastructure. The tooling for virtualized environment can be totally independent of the vendor of the underlying physical hardware. However, this is not the case with multi-vendor bare-metal infrastructure.There will be significant cost saving and increased utilization of compute resources when the container platforms run on bare-metal servers. This needs tooling that allow the deployment and provisioning to be fully automated with multi-vendor hardware support. The minimum the automation code to handle different hardware (with different model/generation/vendor), the better the automation experience.
